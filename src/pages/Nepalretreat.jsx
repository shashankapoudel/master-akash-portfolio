                        <p className='text-[#666666]'>A Retreat is a special time when you are off from the stresses of your busy life. It is a purposeful spiritual voyage or health getaway that includes practices such as Yoga, meditation, and holistic healing, and is used to rejuvenate, renew, and re-energize your mind, body, and spirit.<br />
                            During a retreat, you walk away and rest from your external stressful experiences, then your normal self, in terms of joy and balance, and well-being, is restored. It is a chance to get still, take a better look at yourself, and walk back to your day-to-day existence totally refreshed.
